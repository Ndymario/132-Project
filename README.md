# 132-Project

Here's where we're going to be sharing our code for our 132-project!

Wehave decided to go with the "Fridge Companion", the other ideas remain for the sake of not getting rid of them.

# IMPORTANT
Currently the RPI branch has the final version of the project. Kitchen.py is our main code for the project.
Github doesn't like pickle files, so when you run the program for the first time set the CLEAR_LIST variable to true and run the program. 
Add something to the list. Then you close the program and set CLEAR_LIST to False. That way the the program can read the pickle file.
